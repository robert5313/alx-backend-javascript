 What ES6 is?
ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) is a version of the JavaScript language specification. It introduced many new features such as arrow functions, template literals, and let and const keywords for declaring variables. These features make JavaScript code more concise, readable, and easier to maintain.
